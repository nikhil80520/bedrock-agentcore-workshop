TABLE 5 - Section 1(j)(2)(E) – Estates and Trusts
.02 Unearned Income of Minor Children Subject to the “Kiddie Tax”.  For taxable years
beginning in 2025, the amount in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I), which is used to reduce the net
unearned income reported on the child’s return that is subject to the “kiddie tax,” is $1,350.
This $1,350 amount is the same as the amount provided in § 63(c)(5)(A), as adjusted for
inflation.  The same $1,350 amount is used for purposes of § 1(g)(7) to determine whether a
parent may elect to include a child’s gross income in the parent’s gross income and to
calculate the “kiddie tax.”  For example, one of the requirements for the parental election is
that a child’s gross income is more than the amount referenced in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I) but less
than 10 times that amount; thus, a child’s gross income for 2025 must be more than $1,350
but less than $13,500.
.03 Maximum Capital Gains Rate (§ 1(h), § 1(j)(5)).  For taxable years beginning in 2025,
the maximum zero rate amounts and maximum 15 percent rate amounts under § 1(j)(5)(B),

amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $17,280.  The available adoption credit begins

(1) In general.  For taxable years beginning in 2025, the following amounts are used to
determine the earned income credit under § 32(b).  The “earned income amount” is the
amount of earned income at or above which the maximum amount of the earned income
credit is allowed.  The “threshold phaseout amount” is the amount of adjusted gross income
(or, if greater, earned income) above which the maximum amount of the credit begins to
phase out.  The “completed phaseout amount” is the amount of adjusted gross income (or, if
greater, earned income) at or above which no credit is allowed.  The threshold phaseout
amounts and the completed phaseout amounts shown in the table below for married
taxpayers filing a joint return include the increase provided in § 32(b)(2)(B), as adjusted for
inflation for taxable years beginning in 2025.  The threshold phaseout amounts and the

income credit for each type of taxpayer.
(2) Excessive Investment Income.  For taxable years beginning in 2025, the earned
income tax credit is not allowed under § 32(i) if the aggregate amount of certain investment

.07 Refundable Credit for Coverage Under a Qualified Health Plan.  For taxable years
beginning in 2025, the limitation on tax imposed under § 36B(f)(2)(B) for excess advance
