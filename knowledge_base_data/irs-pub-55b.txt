Internal Revenue Service Data Book, 2024
iv
Letter from the Acting Commissioner
I’m pleased to present the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Internal
Revenue Service Data Book. This document is designed
to provide multifaceted views of the important work IRS
employees have performed during the past year to help
taxpayers, ensure fair enforcement of tax laws, and main­
tain the integrity of our tax system.
Sharing these data gives readers insight into the broad
scope of our work. The IRS’s activities each year reflect
the importance of the agency and our workforce to the
nation. In FY 2024, the IRS collected approximately
$5.1 trillion in gross revenues, generating about 96%
of the funding that supports the federal government’s
operations.
The hard work of our dedicated employees makes it pos­
sible for the government to perform its vital functions and
fund our nation on everything from infrastructure to defense.
During FY 2024, IRS employees processed more than 266.6
million tax returns and other forms, including 161 million
individual income tax returns.
The past two filing seasons saw continued improvement
in IRS levels of service—on the phone, in person, and on­
line—thanks to the efforts of our workforce and our use of
long-term resources provided by Congress. In FY 2024, our
customer service representatives answered approximately
20 million live phone calls. At our Taxpayer Assistance
Centers around the country, we had more than 2 million
contacts, increasing the in-person help we provided to
taxpayers by nearly 26% compared to FY 2023.
Taxpayers continued their strong use of online offerings
in FY 2024, making nearly 690 million visits to IRS.gov.
There were also more than 382.8 million inquiries on our
popular “Where’s My Refund?” online tool, which enables
taxpayers to check the status of their tax refund—up 26%
from FY 2023.
To ensure taxpayers will continue to see improvements in
online services, we remained focused on the IRS Digital
First Initiative during FY 2024. This is our vision to enable
taxpayers to digitally complete all their transactions with
the IRS if they choose to do so, offering options like what
banks and other financial institutions provide to their cus­
tomers. We’ve created and enhanced online tools that save
taxpayers time and headaches, while at the same time
reducing the need for phone calls and paper processes.
As a result of our efforts, the IRS has launched more digital
tools in the last 2 years than in the previous 20.
As part of this initiative, we broadened the capabilities of
the IRS Online Account and Tax Pro Account in FY 2024
to give taxpayers and tax professionals the ability to
perform more types of transactions in their accounts. For
example, they can now view key details of their tax return,
get account transcripts, and view or make payments to
us. We also expanded the functionality of the Business
Tax Account and expanded the types of users to include
C corporations, so that millions of businesses now qualify
to use this self-service tool.
In the area of compliance, our commitment to maintaining
a visible, robust tax enforcement presence to appropri­
ately support taxpayers and promote fairness in the tax
system remained strong. We continued to make progress
developing and using innovative approaches to better
understand, detect, and resolve potential noncompliance,
such as leveraging new technology and data analytics to
fairly enforce the tax laws.
This year’s Data Book provides many interesting statistics
about our operations over the past year. The improvements
we have already made and the ones we will continue to make
in FY 2025—and the years beyond—will make a difference for
our agency. We are confident these efforts will produce sig­
nificant benefits for taxpayers, the tax system, and the nation.

[1]	 Gross collections include penalties and interest in addition to taxes.
[2]	 Includes overpayment refunds, refunds resulting from examination activity, refundable tax credits, and other refunds required by law. Also includes $5.3 billion in
interest, of which $1.6 billion was paid to corporations and $3.7 billion was paid to all others (related to individual, employment, estate, gift, and excise tax returns).
Excludes refunds credited to taxpayer accounts for tax liability in a subsequent year.
[3]	 Less than 0.05%.
[4]	 Collections of withheld individual income tax are not reported by taxpayers separately from Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Hospital Insurance (OASDHI) taxes
on salaries and wages (under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or FICA) and individual income tax payments along with taxes on self-employment income
(under the Self-Employment Insurance Contributions Act or SECA). The OASDHI tax collections and refunds shown in this table are based on estimates made by
the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 201(a) of the Social Security Act as amended and include all OASDHI taxes. Amounts shown
for individual income tax withheld and individual income tax payments were derived by subtracting the FICA and SECA tax estimates from total individual income
tax withheld and individual income tax payments. Refund estimates, and, therefore, net collection estimates, were not made for the components of income and
OASDHI taxes.
[5]	 Includes collections of estimated income tax and payments made in conjunction with individual income tax return filings.
[6]	 Includes collections of estimated estate and trust income taxes and payments made in conjunction with estate and trust tax return filings.
[7]	 Excludes excise taxes collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
All money amounts are in current dollars.
Collection and refund data may not be comparable for a given fiscal year because payments made in prior years may be refunded in the current fiscal year.
Partnership, S corporation, regulated investment company, and real estate investment trust data are not shown in this table since these entities generally do not
have a tax liability. Instead, they pass any profits or losses to the underlying owners, who include these profits or losses on their income tax returns.

NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
Classification by state is based on the individual’s address (or, in the case of businesses, the location of the principal office or place of business). However, some
individuals may use the address of a tax attorney or accountant. Sole proprietors, partners in a partnership, or shareholders in an S corporation may use their
business addresses. Such addresses could have been located in a state other than the state in which the individual resided. Similarly, taxes withheld reported by
employers located near a state boundary might include substantial amounts withheld from salaries of employees who reside in a neighboring state. Also, while
taxes of corporations may be paid from the principal office, the operations of these corporations may be located in one or more state(s).

rations); and 8868 (automatic filing extension for tax-exempt organizations). The IRS began offering an electronic option for Form 1040–X in August 2020. Starting
in FY 2022, the supplemental documents report includes the electronic Form 1040–X.
[12]	Includes U.S. territories other than Puerto Rico, U.S. Armed Service members overseas, and international.
NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
Classification by state is based on the individual’s address (or, in the case of businesses, the location of the principal office or place of business). However, some
individuals may use the address of a tax attorney or accountant. Sole proprietors, partners in a partnership, or shareholders in an S corporation may use their
business addresses. Such addresses could have been located in a state other than the state in which the individual resided. Similarly, taxes withheld reported by
employers located near a state boundary might include substantial amounts withheld from salaries of employees who reside in a neighboring state. Also, while
taxes of corporations may be paid from the principal office, the operations of these corporations may be located in one or more state(s).

Table 5.  Gross Collections, by Type of Tax and State, Fiscal Year 2024—Continued
Footnotes
[1]	 Gross collections include penalties and interest in addition to taxes.
[2]	 Includes taxes on corporation income (Form 1120 series) and unrelated business income from tax-exempt organizations (Form 990–T).
[3]	 Collections of withheld individual income tax are not reported by taxpayers separately from Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Hospital Insurance (OASDHI) taxes
on salaries and wages (under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or FICA) and individual income tax payments along with taxes on self-employment income
(under the Self-Employment Insurance Contributions Act or SECA). Thus, while Table 1 shows these amounts separately for the United States total, separate
amounts are not available by state.
[4]	 Includes collections of estimated estate and trust income taxes and payments made in conjunction with estate and trust tax return filings.
[5]	 Excludes excise taxes collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
[6]	 Includes tax and excess withholding payments not classified by state as of the end of the fiscal year because they had not been applied to taxpayer accounts.
Undistributed amounts may be negative when adjustments to taxpayer accounts have not been completed.
NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
Partnership, S corporation, regulated investment company, and real estate investment trust data are not shown in this table since these entities generally do not
have a tax liability. Instead, they pass through any profits or losses to the underlying owners, who include these profits or losses on their income tax returns.
This table shows gross collections. Gross collections less refunds equal net collections. See Table 1 for refunds and net collections.
Collection and refund data may not be comparable for a given fiscal year because payments made in prior years may be refunded in the current fiscal year.
Adjustments to prior-year refunds made in Fiscal Year 2024 may result in negative amounts when such adjustments exceed current-year collections. See Tables 7
and 8 for refund data by state.
Classification by state is based on the individual’s address (or, in the case of businesses, the location of the principal office or place of business). However, some
individuals may use the address of a tax attorney or accountant. Sole proprietors may use their business addresses. Such addresses could have been located in
a state other than the state in which the individual resided. Similarly, taxes withheld and reported by employers located near a state boundary might include sub­
stantial amounts withheld from salaries of employees who reside in a neighboring state. Also, while taxes of corporations may be paid from the principal office, the
operations of these corporations may be located in one or more other state(s).

Table 6. Gross Collections, by Type of Tax, Fiscal Years 1960 – 2024—Continued
Footnotes
[1] Gross collections include penalties and interest in addition to taxes.
[2] Includes taxes on corporation income (Form 1120 series) and on unrelated business income from tax-exempt organizations (Form 990–T).
[3] Income tax reported for estates and trusts is included in individual income tax in Fiscal Years (FY) 1960–2007. Beginning with FY 2008, estate and trust income tax
is reported separately.
[4] Includes taxes for Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Hospital Insurance (OASDHI); unemployment insurance under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA);
and railroad retirement under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA).
[5] Excludes excise taxes collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Internal Revenue Service col-
lected taxes on alcohol and tobacco until FY 1988 and taxes on firearms until FY 1991.
[6] Represents fiscal-year transitional period, July 1976 through September 1976, resulting from redefinition of the term “fiscal year.” FY 1976 covered July 1975
through June 1976 (earlier years were similarly defined). FY 1977 covered October 1976 through September 1977 (subsequent years are similarly defined).
[7] The estate tax was temporarily repealed for deaths in Calendar Year (CY) 2010 before being reinstated retroactively with a $5-million exemption as part of the Tax
Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a result of this legislation, the estates of CY 2010 decedents could elect to file
either Form 706 (estate and generation-skipping transfer tax return), due September 19, 2011, or Form 8939 (allocation of increase in basis for property acquired
from a decedent), due January 17, 2012. The law also provided a $5-million exemption for the estates of CY 2011 decedents. These tax law changes significantly
reduced estate tax gross collections in FY 2011 relative to other fiscal years.
NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
All money amounts are in current dollars.
Partnership, S corporation, regulated investment company, and real estate investment trust data are not shown in this table since these entities generally do not
have a tax liability. Instead, they pass any profits or losses to the underlying owners, who include these profits or losses on their income tax returns.
This table shows gross collections. Gross collections less refunds equal net collections. See Table 1 for data on refunds and net collections.

d—Not shown to avoid disclosure of information about specific taxpayers. However, the data are included in the appropriate totals.
** —Data have been combined to avoid disclosure of information about specific taxpayers.
N/A—Not applicable.
[1]	 Excludes excise tax returns filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Also excludes returns of tax-exempt
organizations, government entities, employee retirement benefit plans, and tax-exempt bonds; and excludes information returns (e.g., Forms 1098, 1099, 5498,
W–2 and W–2G, and Schedule K–1).
[2]	 Field examinations are generally performed in person by revenue agents, tax compliance officers, tax examiners, and revenue officer examiners. However, some
field examinations may ultimately be conducted through correspondence in order to better serve the taxpayer.
[3]	 In general, total positive income (TPI) is the sum of all positive amounts shown for the various sources of income reported on the individual income tax return, and
thus excludes losses.
[4]	 Includes Forms 1040–PR (self-employment income tax return for Puerto Rico residents) and 1040–SS (self-employment income tax return for U.S. Virgin Islands,
Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands residents).
[5]	 Includes all returns selected for examination on the basis of an earned income tax credit (EITC) claim. Shown separately for information purposes. Counts are
included in the appropriate TPI classes.
[6]	 Includes the Form 1120 series as follows: 1120 (corporation income tax return); 1120–C (income tax return for cooperative associations); 1120–F (foreign corpora­
tion income tax return, except foreign life insurance company, foreign property and casualty insurance company, or foreign sales corporation); 1120–H (homeowner
association income tax return); 1120–L (life insurance company income tax return); 1120–ND (return for nuclear decommissioning funds); 1120–PC (property and

(Form 1120–L); foreign property and casualty insurance companies (Form 1120–PC); or foreign sales corporations (Form 1120–FSC).
[8]	 Includes taxable Form 1041 (income tax return for estates and trusts) and Form 1041–N (income tax return for electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts).
[9]	 Includes Form 706 (estate and generation-skipping transfer tax return). As a result of changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the IRS changed how it catego­
rizes returns based on the size of gross estate amount, effective January 2021. In order to avoid disclosure of information about specific taxpayers, only the total is
provided.
[10]	Includes Forms 1120–FSC (foreign sales corporation income tax return); 1120–S for S corporations reporting a tax (see footnote 12); 1065–B for partnerships
reporting a tax; 8288 (withholding tax return for disposition by foreign persons of U.S. property interests); and 8804 (return of withholding tax on foreign partner’s
share of effectively connected income).
[11]	Nontaxable returns are filed for entities that generally do not have a tax liability but pass through any profits and losses to the underlying owners, who include these
profits or losses on their income tax returns. The examination of partnership, S corporation, and other nontaxable returns affects the amount of recommended ad­
ditional tax for these associated income tax returns.
[12]	Includes most Forms 1120–S, which are filed by qualifying S corporations electing to be taxed through shareholders. Under certain conditions, S corporations are
subject to tax and are included in “Other taxable returns” in this table. See footnote 10.
[13]	Includes the following nontaxable returns: Form 1120–IC–DISC (domestic international sales corporation return); Form 1041 (income tax return for estates and
trusts); and Form 1066 (real estate mortgage investment conduit income tax return). Under certain circumstances, estates and trusts (Form 1041) are not subject to
tax and are reported as nontaxable. See estate and trust income tax returns for taxable Forms 1041.
NOTES:
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
This table includes information on examinations closed in Fiscal Year 2024 of all individual income tax, corporation income tax, estate and trust income tax, estate
tax, gift tax, employment tax, excise tax, and other taxable returns, as well as partnership, S corporation, and other nontaxable returns, and information on exami­
nations in which the taxpayer did not agree with the IRS examiner’s determination. When this occurs, the taxpayer may appeal the decision.
