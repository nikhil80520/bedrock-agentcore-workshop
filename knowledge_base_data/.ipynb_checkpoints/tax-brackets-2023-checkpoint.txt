reference to § 1(f) of the Code.  To the extent amendments to the Code are enacted for
2023 after October 18, 2022, taxpayers should consult additional guidance to determine
whether these adjustments remain applicable for 2023.
SECTION 2. CHANGES
.01 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, § 13303(a)(1) of Public
Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (August 16, 2022), commonly known as the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), modifies the maximum amount of the energy efficient
commercial buildings deduction under § 179D.
(1) For taxable years beginning in 2023, the applicable dollar value used to
determine the maximum allowance of the deduction under § 179D(b) is $0.50 increased
(but not above $1.00) by $0.02 for each percentage point by which the total annual
energy and power costs for the building are certified to be reduced by a percentage
greater than 25 percent.
(2) For taxable years beginning in 2023, the applicable dollar value used to
determine the increased deduction amount for certain property under § 179D(b)(3)(A) is
$2.50 increased (but not above $5.00) by $0.10 for each percentage point by which the
total annual energy and power costs for the building are certified to be reduced by a
percentage greater than 25 percent.
.02 The amounts set forth in section 2.01 of this revenue procedure are adjusted for
inflation for taxable years beginning in 2023.

.02 Unearned Income of Minor Children Subject to the “Kiddie Tax”.  For taxable
years beginning in 2023, the amount in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I), which is used to reduce the
net unearned income reported on the child’s return that is subject to the “kiddie tax,” is
$1,250.  This $1,250 amount is the same as the amount provided in § 63(c)(5)(A), as
adjusted for inflation.  The same $1,250 amount is used for purposes of § 1(g)(7) to
determine whether a parent may elect to include a child’s gross income in the parent’s
gross income and to calculate the “kiddie tax.”  For example, one of the requirements
for the parental election is that a child’s gross income is more than the amount
referenced in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I) but less than 10 times that amount; thus, a child’s gross
income for 2023 must be more than $1,250 but less than $12,500.
.03 Maximum Capital Gains Rate (§1(h), §1(j)(5)).  For taxable years beginning in
2023, the maximum zero rate amounts and maximum 15 percent rate amounts under

.04 Adoption Credit.  For taxable years beginning in 2023, under § 23(a)(3) the credit
allowed for an adoption of a child with special needs is $15,950.  For taxable years
beginning in 2023, under § 23(b)(1) the maximum credit allowed for other adoptions is
the amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $15,950.  The available adoption credit
begins to phase out under § 23(b)(2)(A) for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross
income in excess of $239,230 and is completely phased out for taxpayers with modified
adjusted gross income of $279,230 or more.  See section 3.19 of this revenue
procedure for the adjusted items relating to adoption assistance programs.
.05 Child Tax Credit.  For taxable years beginning in 2023, the amount used in
§ 24(d)(1)(A) to determine the amount of credit under § 24 that may be refundable is
$1,600.
.06 Earned Income Credit.
(1) In general.  For taxable years beginning in 2023, the following amounts are
used to determine the earned income credit under § 32(b).  The “earned income
amount” is the amount of earned income at or above which the maximum amount of the
earned income credit is allowed.  The “threshold phaseout amount” is the amount of
adjusted gross income (or, if greater, earned income) above which the maximum
amount of the credit begins to phase out.  The “completed phaseout amount” is the
amount of adjusted gross income (or, if greater, earned income) at or above which no
credit is allowed.  The threshold phaseout amounts and the completed phaseout
amounts shown in the table below for married taxpayers filing a joint return include the
--- Page 10 ---
- 10 -
increase provided in § 32(b)(2)(B), as adjusted for inflation for taxable years beginning
in 2023.  The threshold phaseout amounts and the completed phaseout amounts shown
in the table below for single, surviving spouse, or head of household taxpayers also
apply to married taxpayers who are not filing a joint return and satisfy the special rules
for separated spouses in § 32(d).
