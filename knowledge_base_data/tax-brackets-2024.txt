SECTION 1. PURPOSE
This revenue procedure sets forth inflation-adjusted items for 2024 for various Code
provisions as in effect on November 9, 2023.  The inflation adjusted items for the Code
sections set forth in section 3 of this revenue procedure are generally determined by
reference to § 1(f).  To the extent amendments to the Code are enacted for 2024 after
November 9, 2023, taxpayers should consult additional guidance to determine whether
these adjustments remain applicable for 2024.
SECTION 2. CHANGES
.01 For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, § 13601(a)(2) of Public
Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (August 16, 2022), commonly known as the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), reinstates the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate
for crude oil received at a United States refinery and petroleum products entered into the
United States for consumption, use, or warehousing under § 4611.  The rate of tax imposed
by § 4611 is the sum of the Hazardous Substance Superfund rate and the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund financing rate.  In the case of crude oil or petroleum products entered after
December 31, 2016, for calendar years beginning in 2023, the rate of tax imposed by
§ 4611(a) is $0.254 cents a barrel.
.02 The Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate described in section 2.01 of this
revenue procedure is adjusted for inflation for calendar years beginning in 2024.

TABLE 5 - Section 1(j)(2)(E) – Estates and Trusts
.02 Unearned Income of Minor Children Subject to the “Kiddie Tax”.  For taxable years
beginning in 2024, the amount in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I), which is used to reduce the net
unearned income reported on the child’s return that is subject to the “kiddie tax,” is $1,300.
This $1,300 amount is the same as the amount provided in § 63(c)(5)(A), as adjusted for
inflation.  The same $1,300 amount is used for purposes of § 1(g)(7) to determine whether a
parent may elect to include a child’s gross income in the parent’s gross income and to
calculate the “kiddie tax.”  For example, one of the requirements for the parental election is
that a child’s gross income is more than the amount referenced in § 1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I) but less
than 10 times that amount; thus, a child’s gross income for 2024 must be more than $1,300
but less than $13,000.
.03 Maximum Capital Gains Rate (§1(h), §1(j)(5)).  For taxable years beginning in 2024,
the maximum zero rate amounts and maximum 15 percent rate amounts under § 1(j)(5)(B),

amount of earned income at or above which the maximum amount of the earned income

(or, if greater, earned income) above which the maximum amount of the credit begins to
phase out.  The “completed phaseout amount” is the amount of adjusted gross income (or, if

amounts and the completed phaseout amounts shown in the table below for married
